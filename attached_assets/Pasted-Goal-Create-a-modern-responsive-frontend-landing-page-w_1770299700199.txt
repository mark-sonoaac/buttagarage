Goal:
Create a modern, responsive frontend landing page website for an auction dealership named Butta the Auctioner. This site focuses on buying cars at auction and selling them at low, transparent prices. The goal is trust, speed, and value.

General Rules

Frontend only (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

No backend, no databases

Do NOT create other pages yet (only links/placeholders)

Buttons should be functional but route to # anchors or placeholder modals

Use the existing reference image in Replit as inspiration only

Match layout flow and polish

Do NOT copy text, branding, or exact structure

Make it clean, bold, dealership-style, and modern

Mobile-first, fully responsive
