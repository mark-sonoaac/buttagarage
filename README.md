# Butta the Auctioner — Landing Page

Modern, responsive landing page for **Butta the Auctioner**, an auto auction dealership focused on fast sourcing and transparent, low pricing.

## Description
Butta buys vehicles straight from auction and sells them without the typical dealer markup. The site is built to feel confident and straightforward, with clear steps, trust messaging, and a contact flow.

## Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Wouter (routing)
- TanStack Query (data fetching)
- Express (serves the app + simple API)
- Drizzle ORM + Postgres (stores contact requests)

## Run Locally (Replit)
1. Click **Run**.
2. The app will start on port **5000**.

## Notes
- This is primarily a **frontend landing page** experience.
- The **Contact Butta** form submits to a simple API so messages can be saved and viewed in the Leads drawer.
- Inventory, About, Contact, and FAQ links are placeholders for now.
- Additional pages and backend features are coming later.
